# CSI2110
Assignments for CSI2110 Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)

## A2 - A heap-based priority queue

- uses two heaps, links between nodes
- allows removal from either end
- removeMin/removeMax delegate to a single semi-polymorphic implementation, removeExtremum, to avoid duplication

## A4 - A page-rank calculator

## BST Iterators

Not an assignment, just playing around with how to implement pre/in/post-order iterators for binary search trees which only stores the previous node as state
